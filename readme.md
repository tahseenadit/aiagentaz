# AI Agent AZ

A Python package that provides a simple and unified interface for interacting with various AI services.

## Features

- ü§ñ Unified interface for different AI service providers
- ‚õìÔ∏è Decorator-based chain operations

## Installation

```bash
pip install aiagentaz
```

## Quick Start

```python
from aiagentaz.domain.agent import Agent

my_agent = Agent(
    client="openai", 
    api_key="your-api-key"
)
res = my_agent.generate( 
    model="gpt-4", 
    prompt="Can you give me a hello world program in python?", 
)
print(res.content)
```

## Chain Examples

Chain multiple operations using decorators:

```python
from aiagentaz.domain.chain import chain

# Define chain of operations
@chain
def get_prompt():
    return "Write a story about a magical forest"

@get_prompt
def enhance_prompt(previous_response: str = None):
    return previous_response + " Give it a title and a short description"

@enhance_prompt
def add_details(previous_response: str = None):
    return previous_response + " Generate a list of 5 key events in the story"

# Execute the chain
result = add_details()
print(result)
```

Each function in the chain can access the result of the previous function through the `previous_response` parameter.
